# Webots-Docker
## Setup
Clone this repository and build the docker image with:
````
./build.sh
````
## Run
Open a terminal and run:
````
./launch.sh
````
Open a browser and connect to Jupyter lab at the address [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

Open a terminal in Jupyter lab and run:
````
./launch_webots.sh

Open a new broser tab/window, and open the file `index.html`.

Press the `connect` button.

It seems to connect to the Webots streaming server, but the window remains black :-(
